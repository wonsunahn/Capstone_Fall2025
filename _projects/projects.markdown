## Pittsburgh Policy Initiative 
### Pittsburgh Food Access Map

**Objective:**
The objective of this food access map project is to revitalize and expand an interactive Pittsburgh Food Access Map. The tool will enable users—including Pitt students, community members, and nonprofits—to locate food resources throughout the city, such as grocery stores, corner stores, farmers’ markets, food pantries, and mutual aid sites. The initial phase of the project will prioritize a streamlined, functional version of the platform with a core set of essential features. This ensures the tools is accessible, reliable, and useful from the outset, while leaving room for additional features to be incorporated as capacity allows. In this way, the updated map will serve as both a community resource to improve food security and a research tool to inform advocacy and policymaking.

**Background:**
Food insecurity is a persistent challenge in Pittsburgh, with many neighborhoods lacking consistent access to affordable, healthy food. In 2019, Code for Good Pittsburgh developed a food access map that helped visualize food deserts and the availability of resources. However, the tool is no longer maintained, and much of the information is outdated.

The Pittsburgh Policy Initiative (PPI), Pitt’s premier student-run think tank, is working to bring the map back to life as part of its Food Security project team. The project will merge technical development with community engagement, creating a sustainable and user-friendly platform that supports both everyday residents and local policy discussions around food security.

- [Code for Pittsburgh](https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/FoodAccessMap/index.html)

**Project Goals and Deliverables:**

Priority Areas:

1. Platform Redevelopment:
    a. Build a new version of the food access map (web/mobile hybrid) from scratch
    b. Incorporate an interactive interface that allows users to filter by food source type, neighborhood, hours of operation, etc.
    c. Ensure accessibility features (mobile-friendly, clear icons, color contrast)
2. Data Integration and Management 
    a. Collect and integrate datasets from local sources, avoiding web-scraping if possible
    b. Develop a pipeline or backend that allows for periodic, streamlined data updates
    c. Create an admin dashboard for PPI or community partners to add/edit food source information
3. Sustainability and Documentation
    a. Provide clear technical documentation for future student developers
    b. Create a user manual for non-technical community partners
    c. Plan for long-term hosting and stewardship so the platform can remain active beyond the initial development phase

Secondary Areas:
1. Explore integrating APIs (e.g., Google Maps API for routing and directions)
2. Include a reporting feature that allows community members to submit corrections or new food resources, with a review process continued by PPI to ensure accuracy and reliability
3. Gather feedback from community members and stakeholders to refine the tool and ensure it provides value beyond existing platforms.

Team Size: 2-4 students

## Borges Center
### Borges Site Migration
**Summary:**
The [Borges Center’s website](https://www.borges.pitt.edu/) must be migrated from Drupal to OpenScholar.  The primary goal is to maintain the site's existing design, structure, and functionality between platforms to the largest extent possible. Technical skills required for this project include knowledge of Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Drupal, as well as web development expertise in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Prior experience with payment gateway services such as Authorize.net is also needed to facilitate the transition of the shopping cart feature.

There are some unique challenges to this project, ones that most developers will encounter somewhere during their professional careers.  The first challenge is that the project team will not have any documentation about the existing functionality.  Further, the person(s) who built the site no longer work for the University and therefore are not available to answer questions about the site; executive decisions will need to be made that allow the site to continue to operate as faithfully as possible to the existing functionality and using the current design. This project also requires the team to ensure a seamless cutover between platforms. Lastly, the site will need to be developed in such a way that there is no planned, manual intervention required.   

**Project Team**

The ideal team for this project is 3-4 students. 
- Systems Analyst  
- Web Developer/Programmers (1-2)  
- Data Migration Specialist 

**Required Skills**
- PHP
- Javascript/Ajax/jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL

### RAG Chatbot
We propose developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers user queries using information retrieved from a curated knowledge base. Instead of relying solely on a language model, the chatbot retrieves relevant passages from uploaded documents (e.g., policies, FAQs, financial guides) and uses them to generate fact-based, cited answers. This approach improves accuracy and transparency compared to a plain LLM.

**Key Components & Technologies**

- Document Ingestion: Students parse PDFs/HTML/DOCX, split into manageable chunks, and store them with metadata.
- Vector Search (Retrieval): Using an open-source vector database like FAISS, Chroma,
- Generation: An LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, or open source like LLaMA via Ollama/vLLM) generates answers grounded in retrieved text.
- APIs & UI: A simple backend (FastAPI) with a lightweight UI (Streamlit or React) for users to interact with the chatbot and view source citations.
- Optional Enhancements: Reranking for better retrieval, PII redaction (e.g., Presidio), evaluation metrics (groundedness/accuracy), and feedback capture.

Overall Student Benefits
- Hands-on experience with modern NLP pipelines (embeddings, retrieval, prompt engineering).
- Exposure to vector databases and information retrieval.
- Integration skills: backend APIs, simple frontend, and connecting multiple components.
- Emphasis on responsible AI (fact-grounding, citation, guardrails).
- Cloud-independent; runs locally with Docker, enabling cost-free experimentation.

# Faculty Projects
## Benjamin Rottman
### Using LiDAR Generated Maps of Homes for Recommending Ways to Reduce Carbon Footprint

Homes are responsible for about 20% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through heating and cooling needs. Our general goal is to build a smartphone app that helps homeowners decide among different ways to reduce the energy consumption of the home (e.g., installing insulation in a wall, replacing the AC with a more efficient model). Newer iPhones have LiDAR built in, which allows for apps (e.g., polecat, magic plan, roomscan, Canvas: LiDAR 3D Measurements) that can make 3D floorpans.

Goal 1:

Import and integrate the 3D floor plan into our app. This will allow users of the app to do things like name rooms in ways that make sense to them, and link other functions of the app to specific features (e.g., a to-do list that knows what retrofits to do to specific windows).

Goal 2:

Calculate various feature of the home such as square footage, volume, area of walls. These are important for making decisions about retrofitting the home, for example, knowing the size of AC that is needed if the AC is going to be updated, or estimating the cost of adding insulation to walls.


Stretch Goal: 

Ideally, we would also like to be able to automatically detect features such as windows, doors, floors. For example, knowing how many floors the home has and the total square area of windows on each side of the house are also very important for providing more specific estimates of heating and cooling needs and recommendations for improvements. 


Technology used:
- Server-side post-processing of LiDAR, RGB data, and 3D maps, which could be done in many languages, likely Python
- Flutter for integrating the 3D maps into our app

Team Size: 2-4 students

### Egocentric Gait Monitoring for Fall Risk Prediction in Older Adults

Project Introduction: Falls are one of the leading causes of injury, loss of independence, and even death among older adults. Timely identification of abnormal gait patterns or mobility decline is critical for preventing falls. However, existing solutions—such as in-home surveillance cameras or phone-based tracking—are often limited by location, compliance, or privacy concerns. In this project, we aim to develop a novel, long-term gait monitoring system using Meta’s Aria smart glasses to passively and continuously capture first-person data from the wearer's perspective.

**Why Egocentric Vision?**

Egocentric (first-person) monitoring offers unique advantages over conventional fixed-camera or handheld methods. Unlike smartphones, which require active operation and can be easily forgotten or misplaced, smart glasses are worn passively and naturally integrate into daily routines. Unlike wall-mounted cameras, which are limited to fixed locations and often unavailable in the homes of independently living seniors, wearable smart glasses move with the user—enabling context-aware, room-independent gait analysis during real-world activities. This makes egocentric vision particularly valuable for long-term monitoring in diverse environments, including the homes of seniors who live alone.

**Research Goals and Impact**

By collecting and analyzing synchronized video, pose, and motion data through Aria’s advanced sensor suite (including IMU and SLAM), we aim to identify subtle gait changes that precede falls. The ultimate goal is to build predictive models that can raise early warnings and assist caregivers or clinicians in timely interventions. The broader impact lies in enabling scalable, privacy-conscious, and ecologically valid fall-risk assessment—paving the way for safer aging-in-place for millions of older adults.

### Optimizing Model Serving for LLM Agents

Modern LLM Agents like ChatGPT and Claude can perform complex tasks by making function calls—pausing to search the web, access tools, or solve problems before continuing their response. However, current systems handle these interruptions inefficiently, leading to slower response times and wasted computational resources. This project aims to develop novel approaches for managing these interruptions more effectively, creating a more responsive and efficient user experience.

Our research focuses on three key challenges: (1) improving memory management during function calls, (2) developing intelligent scheduling algorithms that prioritize requests based on urgency and complexity, and (3) creating prediction models to estimate execution time for different request types. You will contribute to implementing and testing various memory management strategies, analyzing performance across different workloads, and helping design user-focused metrics to evaluate system improvements.

As AI assistants become increasingly integrated into daily life, the efficiency of these systems directly impacts millions of users. Our work has the potential to significantly reduce latency, improve throughput, and create more natural interactions with AI systems. We welcome motivated students with programming experience and interest in AI systems, regardless of prior exposure to large language models. This opportunity provides an excellent foundation for students interested in graduate studies or industry careers in AI systems, high-performance computing, or human-computer interaction.

### Heart Rate monitoring using ANC Earphones
Our research is dedicated to developing a heart rate monitoring system based on ANC headphones. This system captures blood flow pulses on the ear canal wall using ultrasonic signals and combines gyroscope data from the headphones to eliminate motion artifacts caused by body movements, thereby improving the accuracy of heart rate monitoring. In previous work, we tested this system across various activity scenarios and achieved promising results. However, there remains room for further optimization of the model and collection of additional data, especially in diverse environments and under various activities.

The main objective of this research is to further optimize the existing multimodal model and collect more diverse data to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness. We will expand the current research to explore heart rate monitoring performance under various activity conditions and further improve our denoising algorithm to ensure reliable heart rate data in complex real-world environments.

We are recruiting two undergraduate students to assist with follow-up research work. Participants will help collect data and take part in algorithm optimization and implementation. Specific tasks include data collection, model training and testing, as well as result analysis. If you are interested in signal processing, machine learning, health monitoring, and other related fields, and wish to gain hands-on experience in real research projects, we welcome you to join our team!
